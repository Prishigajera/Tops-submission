Que 3) What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC. 
Ans.
     SDLC is the cost-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.
SDLC stand for software development life cycle. 

-seven types of SDLC:
   1) Planning
   2) Requirements analysis
   3) Design
   4) Implementation
   5) Testing
   6) Deployment 
   7) Maintanance

- Phases of SDLC.
     1) Planning 
           This phase involves determining the scope, objectives and feasibility of the project.  
        It includes resource planning, risk analysis, and timeline establishment.

     2) Requirement Analysis
           In this phase, the needs of the stockolders are gathered and documented.   
        This includes functional and non-functional requirements.

     3) Design 
           Based on the requirements, the software architecture is designed. 
        This includes both high-level design  and low-level design.
  
     4) Implementation 
           The actual code is written according to the design specifications. 
        This phase involves developers writing code in the appropriate programming language.

     5) Testing 
           The software is rigorously tested to find and fix bugs. 
        This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

     6) Deployment 
           The software is delivered to the customer and installed on their system. 
        This phase may involve beta testing and final adjustments.

     7) Maintenance 
           the software is monitored for issues and necessary updates or 
        enhancements are made to ensure the software continues to function as expected.
